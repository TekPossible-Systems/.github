# TekPossible Systems

### Welcome to TekPossible Systems - Maintained by @grifkies

My name is Griffin Kiesecker, and I made this organization to help organize my code. TekPossible Systems is a fake company that I design products for so that I can learn and code with more purpose.  
My focus is on completing system administration tasks with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in order to create a repeatable, automated, and configuration managed system. 
If you like what I am doing, please feel free to contact me via my LinkedIn account or my contact email in my website resume. Thank you!
