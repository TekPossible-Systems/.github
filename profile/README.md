# TekPossible Systems

### Welcome to TekPossible Systems - Maintained by @grifkies

My name is Griffin Kiesecker, and I made this organization to help organize my code. TekPossible Systems is a fake company that I design products for so that I can learn and code with more purpose.  
My focus is on completing system administration tasks with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in order to create a repeatable, automated, and configuration managed system. 
If you like what I am doing, please feel free to contact me via my LinkedIn account or my contact email in my website resume. Thank you!

The following are my main repositories of interest:

* [My Website Resume](https://github.com/TekPossible-Systems/tekpossible-resume) - This is my resume. I wrote a basic expressjs site that contains a website format of my resume.
* [TekPossible DevSecOps](https://github.com/TekPossible-Systems/tekpossible-ha-devops) - This is my DevSecOps repository for project TekPossible. Project TekPossible is about creating a DoD inspired security system for using GitOps/DevSecOps with monlithic applications. This repository contains the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) code to create the pipelines and supporting infrastructure for the project.
* [TekPossible Production Infrastructure](https://github.com/TekPossible-Systems/tekpossible-ha-infrastructure) - This is my infrastructure repository for project TekPossible. This repo contains the CDK code for the production environment that the above repo (the DevSecOps repo) deploys to.
* [TekPossible AMI Automation](https://github.com/TekPossible-Systems/tekpossible-ha-ami) - This is the repository that contain the configuration scripts needed to setup our custom AMI for project Tekpossible. The AMI generation itself takes place in the DevSecOps repo. This repo contains the bash and ansible scripts needed to automate the operating system configurations.
* [TekPossible Software Proof of Concept](https://github.com/TekPossible-Systems/tekpossible-ha-software) - This is my software repository for project Tekpossible. This is a proof of concept to show that the above repos are able to deploy a custom software baseline. The software baseline clusters hosts based on their hostnames.
